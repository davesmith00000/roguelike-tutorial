# Following the Roguelike Tutorial

This is an attempt to convert the python [Roguelike tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/) to Scala 3 using Indigo.

I'm following the spirit of the tutorials rather than the letter, since Indigo is an FP engine and the python version uses a lot of mutable constructs. Each part achieves the same goals, and where possible I've mimicked the algorithms and processes.

Everything is being built with [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/) and I'm evolving a [***starter kit***](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/indigo-roguelike-starterkit) that you can use.
